# CAPP-Splitter

CAPP (Curriculum Advising and Program Planning) is a degree audit tool for Ellucian Banner, an industry-standard ERP in higher education. When business operations went remote in light of COVID-19 concerns, my team needed to rapidly identify how to run batch PDF exports of degree audits and, most importantly, efficiently file them individually by student ID. These student population sizes generally run from 600-800 students. I designed this code in Python to read a combined PDF file containing all student audits and split the file into subfiles based on student IDs that were identified via regular expression within the document. This tool has allowed my team to avoid many hours of manual file organization.
